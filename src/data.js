      you have the luck of him looking at you and not running away, you are 
      very lucky. If you have been blessed with the opportunity to pet Kevin, 
      you will have good luck for the rest of your life. This being said, Kevin 
      would like you to please respect his boundries. You cannot try to force 
      his love, that will bring about the opposite of a blessing, it will bring
      a curse. The curse of the Shiba Inus' wrath!`,

      Her love and looks aren't the only thing she has though, she is also doing
      agility training! Here's to being the whole package!`,

      no longer being able to find his mom. He enjoys a good pupacino and would like you

      nice for you to try to become friends with Ducky by bribing her with treats. If she
      still doesn't like you, thats still ok. It takes time and trust, so don't force your
